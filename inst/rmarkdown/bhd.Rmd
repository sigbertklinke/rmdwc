## Boston Housing Data in the library `spData`

### Description

The `boston.c` data frame has 506 rows and 20 columns. It contains the Harrison and Rubinfeld (1978) data corrected for a few minor errors and augmented with the latitude and longitude of the observations. Gilley and Pace also point out that MEDV is censored, in that median values at or over USD 50,000 are set to USD 50,000. 

### Usage
